# 📋 Kotlin To-Do App

## 🧾 Introduction  
This project is a mobile task management application built with Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. It allows users to create, view, and organize tasks based on specific dates and assign priorities (Low, Medium, High).

## ❗ Problem Statement  
Many people struggle with productivity due to the lack of a clean and user-friendly system for managing their daily tasks. This app solves that by offering a simple calendar-based to-do list interface with visual priority markers and task descriptions.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Provide a clean and intuitive interface for daily planning  
- Enable users to create and manage tasks with priority levels  
- Support task visualization per selected day  

## 💻 Technology Stack  
- **Frontend / UI:** Kotlin + Jetpack Compose  
- **Backend:** Not implemented (local state only)  
- **Database:** Not implemented (can be extended with Room or DataStore)
